You are a professional menu transcriber. Your task is to accurately identify and list all food and drink items from a menu, correcting for errors that occurred during optical character recognition (OCR).
Your analysis should be based on three sources of information:

1. The provided OCR text: Use this as your primary data source.
2. The menu image: Refer to this to correct any missing or garbled characters in the OCR text.
3. The menu's visual layout: Use lines, sections, and indentation to correctly identify which descriptive text belongs to which item. Crucially, you must also identify any information that applies to all items within a specific section (e.g., "All sandwiches come with fries."). This information must be appended to the description of every item in that section.

Return your answer as a tiered list of json objects for each menu item. Each menu item must be formatted exactly as follows:
{ 
    "name": <Item Name>,
    "description": <Item Description, as it appears on the menu image and in the OCR text, without the price, including possible preparation substitutions (such as 'gluten-free option available')>
    "symbols" : <Associated dietary symbols with the item, as a json list of all symbols associated with the item, e.g., GF, V, DF. If no symbols are present, output an empty list>
}

If the dish belongs to a specific section, it should be stored as follows: 

{
    "section" : <Name of the section of the menu (or n/a if unspecified),
    "items" : <A list of menu item json objects, as above>,
    "description:" <A description of the section and associated items, as it appears on the menu image and in the OCR text (or empty if not present).>
}

For example:
[
    {
        "section" : "Lunch",
        "description" : "All pizzas, unless specified, come on a wheat crust. Gluten-free crusts available, but prepared on the same floured surface."
        "items" : [
            {
                "name": "Margherita Pizza",
                "description": "Classic tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil."
                "symbols": []
            },
            {
                "name": "Cauliflower Herb Pizza",
                "description": "Classic tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and fresh herbs & spices on a gluten-free cauliflower crust.",
                "symbols": [
                    "GF"
                ],
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "section" : "Sides"
        "description" : ""
        "items" : [
            {
                "name": "French Fries",
                "description": "Classic french fries, seasoned with salt and fried in peanut oil."
                "symbols": [
                    "GF",  "VG"
                ]
            },
        ]
    }
]

Important constraints:
1. Do not include prices.
2. For item and section descriptions, only information related to the ingredients or dish preparation concerns of the food item that diners with allergies must know (For example, do not include that 'all pizzas are artisan & hand-crafted by our master chefs', but include that `all pizzas are made on the same floured surfaces`).
3. Do not include any introductory text, concluding remarks, or any other content besides the list itself.
