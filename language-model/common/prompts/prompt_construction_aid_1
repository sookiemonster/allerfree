Now you are trying to create an LLM agent that predicts whether a given user can eat at a given restaurant. 

Use this to construct a prompt for a generative LLM model that analyzes a text menu input and outputs a list of dishes on 
the menu and predicts how likely they are to contain gluten outputting three possible values "very unlikely", "may contain", or "very likely", and an explanation on why.


The input dishes will detail the dish name, a brief description, and any symbols found (eg. GF for gluten-free). 
Ensure that the prompt specifies the following output structure, based on the following example. 
The input itself will have the a similar schema, the difference being that it will not have the "contains" attribute for any of the dishes. 
{
"sections" : [
    {
        "section" : "Lunch",
        "description" : "All pizzas, unless specified, come on a wheat crust. Gluten-free crusts available, but prepared on the same floured surface."
        "items" : [
            {

                "name": "Margherita Pizza",

                "description": "Classic tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil."

                "symbols": [],
                "contains": [
                    {
                        "allergen" : "gluten",
                        "prediction" : "very likely",
                        "explanation" : "The section descrption outlines that pizzas come on a wheat crust by default, and wheat is not gluten-free."
                    }
                ]
            },
            {

                    "allergen" : "gluten",
                    "prediction" : "very likely",
                    "explanation" : "While the crust is gluten-free as per the GF symbol and menu description, the menu also mentions that all pizzas are made on the same floured surface, so it is likely not gluten-free."
                    }
                 ]
