# Allerfree

**Allerfree makes dining out with allergies a piece of cake.**

## Product vision
Allerfree is built for people with food allergies (and anyone dining with them) who want a faster way to decide where to eat. As a Chrome extension on Google Maps, it analyzes a restaurant’s menu photos and highlights potential allergens using your saved profiles, without requiring you to copy links or upload images elsewhere.

## How it works
1. Open a restaurant on Google Maps and click the **Menu** tab (the one with menu images).  
2. Click **“Can I Eat Here?”** on the menu page.

3. Choose **Analyze All Profiles** or **select multiple profiles** to analyze.

4. Wait while Allerfree analyzes the restaurant’s menu photos.
